<h2 id="atlassian-software-engineer-2020-">Atlassian, Software Engineer (2020-)</h2>
<p>Improving the performance, reliability and customer satisfaction of the Atlassian Editor. My code impacts the experience of millions of monthly active users.</p>
<p>It is an <a href="https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/editor/editor-core">advanced WYSIWYG text editor</a> used in production in many Atlassian products - built as an open-source Typescript + React app using the <a href="https://prosemirror.net/">Prosemirror</a> framework.</p>
<h2 id="westpac-software-engineer-6-month-internship-2019">Westpac, Software Engineer, 6 month internship (2019)</h2>
<p>Worked in a team to develop a green-field specialist finance C# .NET application. I helped improve their Agile work practices and development methods.</p>
<h2 id="atlassian-software-engineer-6-month-internship-2018">Atlassian, Software Engineer, 6 month internship (2018)</h2>
<p>Worked with the front-end Editor platform team which builds an <a href="https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/editor/editor-core">advanced WYSIWYG text editor</a> used in production in many Atlassian products. It is an open-source React app using the <a href="https://prosemirror.net/">Prosemirror</a> toolkit written in TypeScript.</p>
<p>Building a rich text editor in a browser is challenging task - there is a huge amount of complexity which must function intuitively to all levels of users, along with a custom document format and robust real-time collaboration between users. I worked with tools such as Bolt, Browserstack and Jest.</p>
<p>Some highlights were: - Implementing a dark mode theme which will ship in the Jira mobile apps in collaboration with the native iOS and Android editor team - Proposing and implementing a change to the Atlassian Document Format used across Atlassian products - Improving the search algorithm to help users insert rich widgets more intuitively</p>
<h2 id="news-corp-australia-6-month-internship-2017">News Corp Australia, 6 month internship (2017)</h2>
<p>Worked in the front-end product development team and with a backend specialist on a relatively small from-scratch project to advance News Corp’s front end stack, a Global Preference Centre for email newsletters <a href="https://www.newsletters.news.com.au/">www.newsletters.news.com.au</a>. It uses Vue.js Server Side Rendering on AWS Lambda behind AWS API Gateway, using GraphQL as an abstraction for legacy systems.</p>
<p>Some things I worked on were: - Tooling for linking multi-repo structure (emulating a monorepo) - Front-end dev of the Vue.js app - Setting up a CI and testing workflow on Atlassian Bamboo using Docker - Implementing AWS Lambda deployments from Bamboo using the Serverless framework - On-demand feature branch deployments to Lambda using AWS API Gateway environment - JS unit tests, setting up Vue component tests using JSDOM, headless parallel Serverless screenshot integration tests - Load testing to determine the best Lambda CPU/RAM settings and cost - Improving SSR performance using AWS X-Ray tracing; ~300ms render time to ~50ms</p>
<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
<h3 id="cloudspotting.app-2019-github.comjakecoppingercloudspotting.app">Cloudspotting.app, 2019 <em><a href="https://github.com/jakecoppinger/cloudspotting.app">github.com/jakecoppinger/cloudspotting.app</a></em></h3>
<p>(No longer in active development due to imagery licencing issues)</p>
<p>Weather radar simplified - a web app that shows every Bureau of Meteorology radar image animated on a slippy map in your exact location. I wrote a custom tileserver which georeferences BOM images and generates slippy map tilesets with Python GDAL and ImageMagick, served up to a Mapbox OpenGL slippy map using an OpenStreetMap cache.</p>
<p>Written in TypeScript (for web and Node) and Python. I also tinkered with FFT powered rain prediction!</p>
<h3 id="sydney-bus-departures-2017-github.comjakecoppingersydney-bus-departures">Sydney Bus Departures, 2017 <em><a href="https://github.com/jakecoppinger/sydney-bus-departures">github.com/jakecoppinger/sydney-bus-departures</a></em></h3>
<p>I created a simple API running on AWS Lambda &amp; Heroku to query real-time Sydney bus arrivals using TfNSW’s Trip Planner API. I also built a Pebble JS app to query my nearest favourite bus stops and get real-time departures. (I previously visualised Sydney transit data along with a short film/swiss poster: <em><a href="https://jakecoppinger.com/transit_in_sydney">jakecoppinger.com/transit_in_sydney</a></em>)</p>
<h3 id="urbanscribe-2016-github.comjakecoppingerurbanscribe">UrbanScribe, 2016 <em><a href="https://github.com/jakecoppinger/urbanscribe">github.com/jakecoppinger/urbanscribe</a></em></h3>
<p>I developed a proof-of-concept system to enable A/B testing in architecture using computer vision. A laptop recognises pedestrians with OpenCV, sends their positions over WiFi to an Arduino which plots their position on a piece of paper.</p>
<h3 id="departing.io-2015-jakecoppinger.comdeparting_io">Departing.io, 2015 <em><a href="https://jakecoppinger.com/departing_io">jakecoppinger.com/departing_io</a></em></h3>
<p>A real-time bus arrivals app for Canberra to simply answer “When will my next bus come”. Built with a Python backend on Heroku which queries the ACT government’s NXTBUS SIRI API and a JS front end that renders on a Canvas using Processing.js</p>
<h3 id="swirlesque-2013-jakecoppinger.comswirlesque">Swirlesque, 2013 <em><a href="http://jakecoppinger.com/swirlesque">jakecoppinger.com/swirlesque</a></em></h3>
<p>A system for interacting with IoT devices using hand gestures. I developed an Arduino based prototype with a low power gesture recognition algorithm, an Android app in Processing and a 3D printed casing through a year long independent research project while in year 12. I presented my research at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvcRfo887Y">TEDxSydney</a>, <a href="http://www.scienceawards.org.au/Alumni-home/Meet-the-Alumni/Jake-Coppinger">Intel ISEF</a>, <a href="http://www.australianscience.com.au/news/teen-innovators-head-to-head-for-top-science-awards/">BHPBSEA</a>, Razorfish, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PwltXKtkKk">CSIRO</a> and was interviewed by <a href="http://kwhs.wharton.upenn.edu/2014/08/intelligent-glove-smartphone-app-teens-perspective-whats-missing-classroom/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/small-business/smallbiz-tech/youll-never-look-at-an-iphone-the-same-20141215-127ubw.html">SMH</a>, <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/innovationchallenge/little-gesture-may-eradicate-clicks-and-taps/story-fnj8drpe-1227094107331">The Australian</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PwltXKtkKk">ABC News</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb1UAHiXuHc">7:30 report</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmZNDREPOIw">Ten</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vt5k36GJIM">7 News</a>.</p>
